# FullStack JavaScript TechDegree
# Project 4: OOP Game Show App

* The goal of this project was to create a browser-based, word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." Youâ€™ll use JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to select a random, hidden phrase, which a player tries to guess, by clicking letters on an onscreen keyboard.

* Using the supplied HTML and CSS files, we had to add our own JavaScript to make the form more user-friendly by:
    * adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
    * validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

# Extra Credit Features
* Let players use their physical computer keyboard to enter guesses; use the keydown or keyup event.
* Make the project my own by making some CSS changes: 
    * Every time page is refreshed, start-screen background colour is different
    * Animated border
    * cool cursor
    

# Key learnings
* An understanding of the basic principles of Object-Oriented Programming
